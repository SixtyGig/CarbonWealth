# CarbonWealth

## About our Project
Have you ever considered the ecological impact of the money you spend? Each dollar bill that you transact, results in a +160g carbon footprint. Before MadHacks 2019, we were unaware of how large an impact someone makes via the carbon "waste" that we leave. 

Our idea: To promote awareness towards the footprint each of us makes. 
What's shown: How much less carbon we use on a per-transaction basis through Capital One's transaction register. 

## Final Thoughts
Before starting this project, both of our team members had minimal knowledge using JavaScript and JQuery. The aim of the project was to create a meaningful experience for users, while teaching ourselves the ins and outs of these two code-bases.
